# Linux notes

It's old version is UNIX, likewise windows old version is DOS. it's development is related 1960-70

-Unix:

Developed in the 1960's nd 70's at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
Designed as a portable, multi-tasking, and multi-user system.
- The source code was proprietary, although it had many variants, including BSD ( Berkeley Software Distribution ) and commercial version like AIX, HP-UX, and Server environments.
- Historically dominant in academic, enterprise, and Server environments.
- Popular variants includes IBM AIX, HP-UX and Oracle solaris.
Linux :

Created by Linus Torevalds in 1991, inspired by the Unix system but not directly derived from its code.
It is an open-source operating system kernel licensed under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ).
Often combined with GNU software to form a complete operating system ( GNU/LINUX ).
Widespread use across servers, desktop, embedded systems, and supercomputer s.
-Popular distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, And Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ).
So Unix become a Linux overall there's a much difference.

#What is operating system ?
~Operating system is a collection of programs that enables communication between computer Hardware and Software.

Win=User > Application > OS > Hardware
Linux=User > Shell > kernel > Hardware

Shell is outer layer of anything, Outer surface of Linux with this we operate Linux
Shell word come from that water shell 🐚 which have pearl inside.

Technically shell is user interface of linux, when we have to control it, command it, operate it so we use shell. Number of shells comes in linux that we can use , for other purposes we have different shells here.


#Functions of Operating System

1) Process Management

2) Memory Management— Ram and harddrive primary and secondary memory here we are talking about. 

3) File system management — Windows have NTFS and FAT. LINUX have EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, XFS.

4) Device Management — OS not directly mange the Hardware but with help of kernel it do, Kernel is in both windows and linux, kernel interact the Hardware same on both. Kernel is a part of OS. In here first Drivers and then kernels. 

5) Security and Protection

6) User Interface

7) Network Management

8) System Performance Monitoring

9) Utilities and Support Services


# Features of Linux

1) Open Source -> Linux is licensed under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ), Which allows users to freely use, modify and distribute the software,The source code is accessible to everyone(This are those softwares which are published with the source code,which anyone can take,use and modify. Like we made a program on C language that difference odd and even numbers when we comply that,an binary is generate,If we share that binary then it's closed source,On the other hand if we share the program that we wrote then it's open source,Which user can coustmize accordingly by there requirements). This Linux OS is fully open source,we can freely coustmize Or modify it and published it by our name,but if we use that financially so the profit that genrate we have to share it and gave reference of source. Like this OS is made on that particular OS source code, that License have it's term And conditions according to that we have follow it. 

2) Multitasking -> Linux can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without degrading performance, making it ideal for both personal and enterprise-level applications.

3) Multi-user Support -> Multiple users can access and work on a Linux system simultaneously without interfering with each other.

4) Portability -> Linux is highly portable and can run on a variety of hardware platforms, from servers and desktops to embedded systems and smartphones.

5) Security -> Linux is designed with robust security features, including file permissions, user authentication, and a strong firewall. It is less prone to malware compared to other operating systems.

6) Customization -> Users can customize Linux to meet their needs by choosing from a variety of distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian) and desktop environments (like GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

7) Command-Line Interface (CLI) -> The Linux terminal offers a rich command-line interface, enabling users to perform complex tasks efficiently through scripting and commands.

8) Stability and Performance -> Linux is known for its stability, often running for years without requiring a reboot. It is also efficient in resource usage, making it suitable for high-performance computing.

9) Package Management -> Linux distributions use package managers (like apt, yum, or pacman) to simplify the installation, updating, and removal of software.

10) Community Support -> Linux has a large and active community of developers and users who provide support, tutorials, and documentation.

11) Free of Cost -> Most Linux distributions are free to download and use, reducing costs for personal users and organizations.
