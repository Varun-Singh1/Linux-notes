# History and Evolution of linux:-
   1. The Birth of Unix (1969):
      Before Linux, there was Unix, an operating system created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs. Unix was powerful, but it was expensive and mostly used in universities and big companies.

   2. MINIX: A Small Unix Clone (1987):
      In 1987, a professor named Andrew Tanenbaum created MINIX, a lightweight version of Unix for educational purposes. However, it had limitations, and its source code was restricted, which frustrated many developers.

   3. Linus Torvalds Creates Linux (1991):
      In 1991, a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds wanted a free, open-source operating system that anyone could use and modify. He started developing a new kernel (core of an OS) and released the first version of Linux on August 25, 1991.

        ! Key Moments in Early Linux:
            ~Torvalds released Linux 0.01 (first version) for free.
            ~Developers worldwide joined the project and improved it.
            ~The Linux kernel was combined with GNU software (created by Richard Stallman) to form a complete OS.
   4. Growth and Popularity (1992 - 2000s):
      ~1992: Linux was licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it truly free and open-source.
      ~1993-1994: Many distributions (distros) like Slackware and Debian were created.
      ~1994: Linux 1.0 was officially released.
      ~1998-2000: Major companies (like IBM, Oracle, and Red Hat) started supporting Linux.
   5. The Rise of Linux in Servers & Enterprises (2000 - 2010s):
      ~2001: Linux powered major web servers (Apache, MySQL, PHP).
      ~2004: Ubuntu was introduced, making Linux easier for general users.
      ~2008: Android, built on the Linux kernel, revolutionized smartphones.
      ~2010s: Cloud computing and supercomputers adopted Linux due to its stability and security.
   6. Modern Linux (2020s and Beyond):
      ~Linux dominates servers (over 90% of web servers run Linux).
      ~Android (based on Linux) runs on billions of devices.
      ~Windows embraced Linux with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
      ~AI, IoT, and supercomputers continue to use Linux for performance.
   7. Why Linux is Important:
      ~Open Source: Anyone can modify and improve it.
      ~Secure and Stable: Less prone to viruses and crashes.
      ~Runs Everywhere: From web servers to smartphones to IoT devices.
      ~Community Support: Millions of developers contribute to it.
