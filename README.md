# Linux notes

Its older version is UNIX, similar to how Windows' early version was DOS. Its development dates back to the 1960s and 1970s. 

# UNIX

Developed in the 1960's nd 70's at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
Designed as a portable, multi-tasking, and multi-user system.
- The source code was proprietary, although it had many variants, including BSD ( Berkeley Software Distribution ) and commercial version like AIX, HP-UX, and Server environments.
- Historically dominant in academic, enterprise, and Server environments.
- Popular variants includes IBM AIX, HP-UX and Oracle solaris.

# LINUX
Created by Linus Torevalds in 1991, inspired by the Unix system but not directly derived from its code.
It is an open-source operating system kernel licensed under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ).
Often combined with GNU software to form a complete operating system ( GNU/LINUX ).
Widespread use across servers, desktop, embedded systems, and supercomputer s.
-Popular distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, And Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ).
So Unix become a Linux overall there's a much difference.

# What is operating system ?
~Operating system is a collection of programs that enables communication between computer Hardware and Software.

Win=User > Application > OS > Hardware
Linux=User > Shell > kernel > Hardware

Shell is outer layer of anything, Outer surface of Linux with this we operate Linux
Shell word come from that water shell üêö which have pearl inside.

Technically shell is user interface of linux, when we have to control it, command it, operate it so we use shell. Number of shells comes in linux that we can use , for other purposes we have different shells here.


# Functions of Operating System

1) Process Management

2) Memory Management‚Äî Ram and harddrive primary and secondary memory here we are talking about. 

3) File system management ‚Äî Windows have NTFS and FAT. LINUX have EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, XFS.

4) Device Management ‚Äî OS not directly mange the Hardware but with help of kernel it do, Kernel is in both windows and linux, kernel interact the Hardware same on both. Kernel is a part of OS. In here first Drivers and then kernels. 

5) Security and Protection

6) User Interface

7) Network Management

8) System Performance Monitoring

9) Utilities and Support Services


# Features of Linux

1) Open Source -> Linux is licensed under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ), Which allows users to freely use, modify and distribute the software,The source code is accessible to everyone(This are those softwares which are published with the source code,which anyone can take,use and modify. Like we made a program on C language that difference odd and even numbers when we comply that,an binary is generate,If we share that binary then it's closed source,On the other hand if we share the program that we wrote then it's open source,Which user can coustmize accordingly by there requirements). This Linux OS is fully open source,we can freely coustmize Or modify it and published it by our name,but if we use that financially so the profit that genrate we have to share it and gave reference of source. Like this OS is made on that particular OS source code, that License have it's term And conditions according to that we have follow it. 

2) Multitasking -> Linux can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without degrading performance, making it ideal for both personal and enterprise-level applications.

3) Multi-user Support -> Multiple users can access and work on a Linux system simultaneously without interfering with each other.

4) Portability -> Linux is highly portable and can run on a variety of hardware platforms, from servers and desktops to embedded systems and smartphones.

5) Security -> Linux is designed with robust security features, including file permissions, user authentication, and a strong firewall. It is less prone to malware compared to other operating systems.

6) Customization -> Users can customize Linux to meet their needs by choosing from a variety of distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian) and desktop environments (like GNOME, KDE, or XFCE).

7) Command-Line Interface (CLI) -> The Linux terminal offers a rich command-line interface, enabling users to perform complex tasks efficiently through scripting and commands.

8) Stability and Performance -> Linux is known for its stability, often running for years without requiring a reboot. It is also efficient in resource usage, making it suitable for high-performance computing.

9) Package Management -> Linux distributions use package managers (like apt, yum, or pacman) to simplify the installation, updating, and removal of software.

10) Community Support -> Linux has a large and active community of developers and users who provide support, tutorials, and documentation.

11) Free of Cost -> Most Linux distributions are free to download and use, reducing costs for personal users and organizations.

# Linux distributions

# CentOS Installation

# Directory structure of Linux

# Remote shell 

# Basic Commands 
 1. hostname :  Hostname is used to display the system's DNS name, and to display or set its hostname or NIS domain name.
 2. pwd(present working directorie) : Print the full filename of the current working directory.
 3. id : Print user and group information for each specified USER, or (when USER omitted) for the current user.
 4. ls : List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.
        Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
        ls -l :
        ls -h , --human-readable : 
        ls -a , --all : 
        ls -R :
        ls -t : 
 6. cd(Change directory)  : home of that user and if that user dont have its home directory then it deny i dont have home.  
                    cd .  : shows the current directory.   
                    cd .. : one folder out from the location.        
 8. Switches or Subcommands : 
             a) -h,--help,help : it will give summarised information theoritically of commmands switches.      
             b) man : man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page asso‚Äê
             ciated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in  that  section  of  the
             manual.The  default  action  is  to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the
             first page found, even if page exists in several sections ( for more practical information of commands switches).                      
       c) info : it have both practical and theoritical info of commands switches.
 9. ifconfig :  Ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.  It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.  After that, it
               is usually only needed when debugging or when system tuning is needed. If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the status of the currently active interfaces.  If a single 
               interface argument is given, it displays the  status  of  the  given interface only; if a single -a argument is given, it displays the status of all interfaces, even those that 
               are down.       
           ifconfig -a :  display all interfaces which are currently available, even if down.   
           ifconfig -s :  display a short list (like netstat -i).     
           ifconfig -v :  be more verbose for some error conditions.
10. touch : create an empty file at the present location, example.
           [root@localhost Desktop]# touch file.txt
           [root@localhost Desktop]# ls
           file.txt
       -  we can create mutiple files with by space between and there name like this,
         [root@localhost Desktop]# touch f1.txt f2.txt f3 f4
         [root@localhost Desktop]# ls
         f1.txt  f2.txt  f3  f4
       - and if we want to create a file by name which have space we can by naming it in double qoutes (" ") like this
         [root@localhost Desktop]# touch "varin local"
         [root@localhost Desktop]# ls
         'varin local'
12. file : describes the media type of file, example.
           [root@localhost Desktop]# file file.txt
           file.txt: empty
13. cat : to read the files we use cat commands
