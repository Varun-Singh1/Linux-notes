# History and Evolution of Linux

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that has grown a lot since it first started. It began as a small project by Linus Torvalds and is now used everywhere—from personal computers to powerful servers and even mobile phones.

# How Linux Started (1991-1994)

Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, a student from Finland, in 1991. He wanted to make a free operating system like Unix, which was expensive. He shared his work with other programmers on the internet, and many people joined in to improve it. The first version of Linux (0.01) was released in 1991, but it was just a kernel (the core part of an operating system). To make it a full system, developers combined it with software from the GNU Project, which had many useful programs.

# Early Growth and First Linux Versions (1994-2000)

By 1994, Linux 1.0 was ready and had networking support. It quickly became popular, and different versions, called distributions (or distros), were created to make it easier for people to use. Some of the first distros included Slackware (1993), Debian (1993), and Red Hat Linux (1995). These helped Linux grow and made it more useful for different types of users.

Since Linux was stable, secure, and free, many tech experts and companies started using it instead of expensive operating systems like Windows and Unix.

# Linux Becomes Popular in Companies (2000-2010)

In the early 2000s, big companies like IBM, Oracle, and HP started using and supporting Linux. This made it more trusted in businesses. The Linux 2.4 and 2.6 versions brought major improvements, making it work better on different computers.

Two popular business versions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), became important during this time. Also, in 2004, Ubuntu was launched, which made Linux easier to use for regular people.

Another big moment was in 2008 when Google released Android, a mobile operating system based on Linux. This showed that Linux could run on more than just computers—it could also power smartphones.

# Linux Takes Over the Tech World (2010-Present)

After 2010, Linux became the backbone of modern technology. The Linux kernel kept improving, adding better security, speed, and support for new hardware. Companies started using Linux for cloud computing, website hosting, and large-scale applications.

New technologies like Docker (used for running software in containers) and Kubernetes (for managing software) made Linux even more important for businesses. Cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure also use Linux servers.

Linux is now the number one choice for supercomputers, and since 2017, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.
