📂 Linux Directory Structure
# Directory	Purpose
/bin	Essential binaries (executables)
/sbin	System binaries (admin tools)
/etc	Configuration files
/home	User home directories
/root	Root user's home directory
/var	Variable data (logs, cache)
/usr	User programs & libraries
/lib & /lib64	Shared libraries
/tmp	Temporary files
/dev	Device files (hard drives, printers)
/proc	System process information
/sys	Kernel and device management info
/opt	Optional third-party software
/boot	Bootloader files
/mnt & /media	Mount points for drives
/srv	Service-related data
# 🔗 Remote Shell
The shell is the command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Linux.
Every shell maintains a history file (e.g., .bash_history for Bash shell).
